# SEE-project
A long project with the goal to create an accurate MC model of secondary electron emission in dielectric materials. 
For a more extensive explanation of both the entirety of this project and the individual codes I recommend going to my blog page at https://guusreefman.com/.

Any constructive feedback is welcome, either here or on my blog.
